            <p>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft that adds static typing to the language.
                 This means you can define variable types, function parameters, and return types, which helps catch
                  errors during development rather than at runtime. TypeScript also introduces features like interfaces,
                   enums, and advanced object-oriented programming concepts, making it easier to manage larger codebases 
                   and improve code quality.

                TypeScript code is compiled down to plain JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with any environment that 
                supports JavaScript, such as web browsers and Node.js. Itâ€™s widely used in modern web development, 
                especially with frameworks like Angular and React.</p>
