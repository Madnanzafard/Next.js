            <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and
                 formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS controls the layout, colors, fonts, 
                 and overall visual appearance of web pages, allowing for separation of content (HTML) from design. 
                 This makes it easier to maintain and update the look of a website without altering the underlying 
                 HTML structure. CSS can be applied inline, embedded within the HTML, or linked as an external stylesheet,
                 providing flexibility in styling web content.</p>
