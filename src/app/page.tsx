      Artificial intelligence (AI) technology refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems.
       This includes capabilities such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.
        AI is transforming various industries, from healthcare, where it aids in diagnosis and personalized treatment,
         to finance, where it enhances risk assessment and fraud detection. Machine learning, a subset of AI, 
         allows systems to improve from experience by analyzing vast amounts of data,
          leading to more accurate predictions and insights. As AI continues to evolve,
           it raises important ethical considerations regarding privacy, bias, and the future of work,
            prompting ongoing discussions about its role in society.</p>
